## Project Summary

In PS1 we queried token data from Infura, alchemy, and QuickNode and then we analyzed ERC20 and ERC271 tokens, respectively. I chose to analyse the SushiToken and tokens from the Bathing Ape Yacht Club. During the weekly reflection, we analyzed a pool of literature for word connections and created figures to show which words were most commonly used in the title and abstract, and also which words were most commonly paired together. I chose to analyze papers concerning women in technology.
