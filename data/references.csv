The timeline of recent years shows a drop in the interest of women in studying a career related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), just when the demand labor in these fields is growing rapidly and new jobs will continue to emerge, and it is feared that they will not have enough people to cover It There are many social organizations that are taking measures to alleviate this situation, including educational branches, government agencies, industry and technological communities composed of women. In this research, the cases of industry and communities are studied. It is intended to dissect how these two ecosystems work to strengthen mechanisms that minimize the gender gap. On the one hand, the paper addresses, what are the communities, why they arise, what are their objectives, what they contribute to society and what actions they develop to contain the problem. Regarding companies, three major leaders of the sector, namely, Google, IBM and Microsoft, show their weaknesses and successes, and present development programs created to improve the internal situation in the themes of diversity and inclusion."

Many are focused on increasing the pipeline of women studying STEM in high school and college. But pipeline factors are not the only reason for the low numbers of women: Companies are failing to retain the female employees they have. A study by Jennifer Glass and coauthors in 2013 found that women leave STEM fields at dramatically higher rates than women in other occupations. After 12 years, 50% of technical women, predominately in engineering and computer science, had switched to other fields; 20% of other women professionals had done the same."
"Journal Article","Bebbington D","Women in science, engineering and technology: A review of the issues","Higher education quarterly","2002","56","4","360-375","","Wiley Online Library","","2002","Concern continues to be expressed over women’s difficulties in advancing their careers as academic scientists. Though some sciences may be numerically ‘feminised’, few women reach the upper echelons of science. Scant attention has been paid to issues of the progression of women from non–traditional backgrounds, such as those from ethnic minorities, who may be particularly disadvantaged. What research there is indicates a variation between the sciences in terms of women’s careers and patterns that are replicated globally. Explanations are now focusing on how the scientific culture itself acts as a barrier to women rather than on the notion that women themselves lack the requisite skills. The Athena Project is a policy response to this issue. Future research and policy needs to look more closely at differences between the sciences, how women from diverse backgrounds experience the academic labour market and epistemological connections between employment and engagement with the scientific agenda."
"Journal Article","Powell C,Chang AM","Women in tech as a driver for growth in emerging economies","Council on Foreign Relations","2016","","","","","","","2016","As the world transitions to an increasingly digital economy, many low- and middle-income countries facean obstacle: most emerging economies lack qualified people to fill critical information and communication technology (ICT) jobs, a shortage that is exacerbated by the low representation of women in these industries.1 The gap between the demand for ICT workers and the supply of job seekers with the necessary technical skills threatens the ability of those countries to participate in a powerful driver of growth in the twenty-first century—the digital economy. Increasing the participation of women in the ICT labor force would help bridge this gap, but women are not yet able to take full advantage of this growing sector. While a degree in computer science or engineering is necessary for most professional-level careers in ICT, the share of women graduates in these fields is slipping in many parts of the world."

The study is based in a literature review of issues that help to explain the differences between the genders showing that this is an understudied research area with broad opportunity to further studies with potential to uncover new topics and innovation hubs in the field in and outside the USA. Findings include recommendations about an existing gap and offers possible solutions to conduct systematic research leading to the development of effective approaches to increase and improve the participation of women in technology and business start-ups as an imperative to foster their inclusion in the global economy."

Their impact is well beyond product development. We do not know where this journey will take us, but we do know that women are grossly underrepresented in shaping the outcome. Companies do not exclude women intentionally. Quite the contrary—tech companies are making great efforts to hire women. Still, they struggle to achieve anywhere near 50% women in their workforce or leadership. As a result, women are not participating effectively in reshaping the future of the human experience. We simply must do better."
"Journal Article","Del Carpio L,Guadalupe M","More women in tech? Evidence from a field experiment addressing social identity","Management Science","2022","68","5","3196-3218","","INFORMS","","2022","This paper investigates whether social identity considerations-through beliefs and normsdrive women's occupational choices. We implement two field experiments with potential applicants to a five-month software-coding program offered to women from low-income backgrounds in Peru and Mexico. When we correct the perception that women cannot succeed in technology by providing role models, information on returns and access to a female network, application rates double and the self-selection patterns change. Analysis of those patterns suggests that identity considerations act as barriers to entering the technology sector and that some high-cognitive skill women do not apply because of their high identity costs."

Recruiting has been difficult and those women entering the profession often leave. Gender schema theory adds to the explanation of behaviors and attitudes in the workplace that may adversely impact women in technology. We surveyed members of Systers, an online forum for women in technology, to examine gender schemas of IT women to see if there is a significant difference between them and the general public. Our findings suggest that there is a significant difference in the gender-schemas of women in technology and the gender-schemas of the general population. A subsequent sample of male IT students and men in the general public also indicated a significant difference in gender schemas of these two groups. Implications of these differences and future research in this area are discussed."
"Book","Hill C,Corbett C,St Rose A","Why so few? Women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics","","2010","","","","","ERIC","","2010","The number of women in science and engineering is growing, yet men continue to outnumber women, especially at the upper levels of these professions. In elementary, middle, and high school, girls and boys take math and science courses in roughly equal numbers, and about as many girls as boys leave high school prepared to pursue science and engineering majors in college. Yet fewer women than men pursue these majors. Among first-year college students, women are much less likely than men to say that they intend to major in science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM). By graduation, men outnumber women in nearly every science and engineering field, and in some, such as physics, engineering, and computer science, the difference is dramatic, with women earning only 20 percent of bachelor's degrees. Women's representation in science and engineering declines further at the graduate level and yet again in the transition to the workplace. Drawing on a large and diverse body of research, this report presents eight recent research findings that provide evidence that social and environmental factors contribute to the under-representation of women in science and engineering."

Numerous initiatives have been advocated to address women's underrepresentation in SET in higher education. This article arose out of one such initiative, Winning Women, which was intended to help higher education in Scotland move toward good practice in this field. Two members of the project team describe their key findings and experiences. They illustrate how the underrepresentation of women in SET continues to be both progressive and persistent (using an SET parity index). The conceptual framework was conceived and developed from a metaanalysis of feminist theories of the gendered politics of science and technology."
"Journal Article","Orser B,Riding A,Stanley J","Perceived career challenges and response strategies of women in the advanced technology sector","Entrepreneurship & Regional Development","2012","24","1-2","73-93","","Taylor & Francis","","2012","The objective of this study is to gain a better understanding of the perceived barriers to career advancement specific to women in the advanced technology sectors. Strategies employed in response to perceived barriers are also examined. Empirical results are based on analysis of qualitative data from a sample of 115 women members of Canadian Women in Technology. Personal-, firm- and industry-level barriers to career advancement were documented. The respondents attributed a high proportion of the challenges they encountered to gender. Respondents were most likely to resolve challenges through personal, or ‘do-it-yourself’, solutions. Few cited firm- or industry-related support structures. While mentoring was identified as a frequently used response strategy through which women address career challenges, the majority of firms in the advanced technology sector lack sufficient numbers of suitable women mentors. The lack of mentorship opportunities is particularly acute for women entrepreneurs. The findings are discussed from the context of contradictions between an industry need to attract and retain entrepreneurial talent and respondents’ perceived career barriers. Industry-level remedial strategies are advanced in the form of: a women's mentoring programme; case studies about successful women entrepreneurs and a website to inform women about career advancement strategies. The programmes were designed by the research team to respond to the challenges cited by women and were implemented in cooperation with the trade association as a critical component of an on-going applied research programme."

However, in the new digital age, many contemporary feminists surmise that the link between technology and male privilege is finally being severed. While early second-wave feminism stressed how embedded technology is with capitalist and patriarchal relations, cyberfeminism conceives of the virtuality of cyberspace and the Internet as spelling the end of the embodied basis for sex difference and thus liberating for women. This article presents both pessimistic and optimistic perspectives, drawing on the social studies of technology. The technofeminist approach advocated here recognises that the gender-technology relationship is rapidly changing, while emphasising that this is the result of feminist politics and not technology per se."

However, we know relatively little about the environment women encounter after making it through the educational pipeline. Do technology companies create environments that may dampen women’s interest at the juncture when they are launching their careers? Using original observational data from 84 recruiting sessions hosted by technology companies at a prominent university on the US West Coast, we find that company representatives often engage in behaviors that are known to create a chilly environment for women. Through gender-imbalanced presenter roles, geek culture references, overt use of gender stereotypes, and other gendered speech and actions, representatives may puncture the pipeline, lessening the interest of women at the point of recruitment into technology careers."
"Journal Article","Hay R,Pearce P","Technology adoption by rural women in Queensland, Australia: Women driving technology from the homestead for the paddock","Journal of Rural Studies","2014","36","","318-327","","Elsevier","","2014","The adoption of Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) technologies to optimize beef cattle production in Northern Australia promises to boost the sector's productivity and profitability. This study examines the roles of grazier women in particular in the current use of and further adoption of on farm technology. It adds to the broader literature on women in agriculture, briefly examining feminist theory and then discussing eco feminism, capital resource ownership, and rural residency. The study considered the adoption of specific rural technologies (such as remote cameras, remote weather stations, bore cameras, and other livestock management systems), but found the current use of these tools to be limited. The limited spread of new rural technologies strongly supports the aim of this study, and ultimately, raises the question of who is driving rural technology diffusion and adoption amongst cattle producers. Data collected through 60 conversational interviews and from 141 participants of an online survey established the centrality of women graziers' roles. The research found that women use most components of online technology three times more often than men. While they were sometimes reluctant to take on the digital homestead tasks, by doing so they feel empowered and valued in their work. More importantly, the study found that as technology diffuses into rural settings and is adopted by grazier women, it is modifying gender divisions, specifically away from traditional separate roles and towards productive partnerships in farming families. Those advocating the further adoption of the new PLF technologies need to be mindful of the women graziers' role as busy users and joint decision makers."

The extensive reach and penetration of information technology into virtually every area of society creates enormous opportunities for women. But women's lack of representation in IT design roles may prevent them from capitalizing on these opportunities. Most current discussion and analysis focuses on the increasing numbers of women as users of information technology with great emphasis on their use of the Internet and World Wide Web. Comparatively little attention has been given to the potential role women might play as designers in an information-based society."

This paper attempts to analyze the issues of opportunities and constraints the women employees face in the Information Technology sector in India. IT sector, through its employment, contributes substantially to women empowerment. Its employment potentiality provides inspiration to female students to take up technical and professional courses with an eye to the job market. Most reviews reveal that, notwithstanding overall satisfactory gender neutral pursuit by this sector, an optimal level of gender inclusivity is still to be achieved, especially to the senior level. Moreover, this sector requires to be extra-careful in doing away with the prevailing maladies such as ‘Feminization’, ‘Glass ceiling’ etc. The theoretical aspect of individualization in the workplace is palpable but at the societal level, patriarchal strategies dominate on the Indian psyche.

"Journal Article","Trauth EM","Odd girl out: an individual differences perspective on women in the IT profession","Information Technology & People","2002","","","","","MCB UP Ltd","","2002","This paper develops a theoretical perspective on gender and information technology (IT) by examining socio‐cultural influences on women who are members of the information technology profession in Australia and New Zealand. In‐depth interviews with both practitioners and academics give evidence of a range of socio‐cultural influences on the professional development and working lives of women IT professionals. The paper rejects the essentialist view of women and their relationship to IT that has been put forth in the information systems literature arguing, instead, the primacy of societal and structural influences. The particular contribution of this paper is a theoretical perspective of individual differences which is presented to characterize the way individual women respond in a range of specific ways to the interplay between individual characteristics and environmental influences. This perspective contributes to a better understanding of women’s involvement in the IT sector and suggests areas for proactive policy response."
