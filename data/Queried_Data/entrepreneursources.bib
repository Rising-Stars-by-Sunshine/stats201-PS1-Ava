abstract = The words that have come to be associated with innovative and creative business enterprises – entrepreneur, entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial – have their English origins in the realm of armed conflict. However over time the terms were colonised by the commercial world with the result that by the end of the 20th century the terms have become firmly embed within the language of commerce. Yet along the way the meaning attached to the terms have become disassociated with commerce. By the start of the 21st Century the term entrepreneurial has become a metaphor, a stand in for innovation, creativity, proactivity and risk. It is argued that such a metaphor is not owned by the commercial world and instead is a figure of speech that can be used in any situation where the speaker requires a conceptual word to mean innovation, risk, proactivity and creativity.

abstract = Entrepreneurship, or the act of starting and running a new business, is a key catalyst of economic development. It is also an important driver of economic recovery: from the effects of the recent COVID-19 pandemic as well as more recent shocks, such as the war between Russia and Ukraine, with its related supply chain issues and rising energy costs. At any time, but especially during times of crisis, it is vital that the entrepreneurship dynamics and national frameworks to promote entrepreneurship are carefully defined and measured. Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) research can provide significant metrics to policymakers along the road to economic recovery, which enable informed and astute — but, most importantly, effective — decision-making. This 2022/2023 Global Report presents the results of GEM’s 24th research cycle. This adds another round of extensive national surveys to an already substantial GEM database of entrepreneurial results. In 2022, over 170,000 individuals were interviewed across 49 different economies, adding their views and experiences to over 3 million previously interviewed for the GEM Adult Population Survey (APS) over the previous two decades. These 49 economies represent about two-thirds of the global population in 2022. It includes China with a population of 1.3 billion, as well as India, which according to the United Nations is likely to be declared the world’s most populous country in 2023. Furthermore, GEM’s National Expert Survey (NES) features 51 economies (all of the 49 economies that participated in the GEM APS, plus Italy and Argentina). The NES is a survey of national experts in each economy charged with assessing the key components and characteristics of the entrepreneurial environment for that economy.

abstract = Among many dimensions of entrepreneurship, Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) has tracked the evolution of women’s entrepreneurship worldwide for well over two decades. In so doing, GEM has acted as a veritable observatory, bearing witness to how women’s entrepreneurship has gradually entered the hearts, minds and everyday realities of people in almost every country across the globe. “Leave no one behind” is the core, transformative promise of the multi- stakeholder-driven United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Endemic discrimination — including gender discrimination — is a significant driver of people being “left behind”. This can inevitably lead to individuals, families and even entire communities being marginalized and excluded. Time and time again, GEM research has cast a revealing spotlight on women entrepreneurs, producing data that are testament to the increasing resourcefulness, creativity and capabilities of women when it comes to building companies that grow and prosper.As this report highlights, women entrepreneurs have also shown themselves to be strong and resilient in the face of crisis and chaos. In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to lockdowns across the globe, systemic failures in supply chains and collapsing social support mechanisms. This has left a significant and sometimes devastating imprint on many lives worldwide. However, when children are being educated online at home, or even simply not being formally educated at all, and when there is little to no access to childcare service providers, it is not difficult to work out which constituency of entrepreneurs is most affected by the pandemic. Women entrepreneurs inevitably shouldered the lion’s share of the pandemic effects burden. But, according to our research, many women entrepreneurs managed to turn the new business context to their advantage. As GEM data reveal, women entrepreneurs persisted in seeking opportunities to create businesses, even high-growth businesses. In so doing, they inspired others, especially other women, to also become entrepreneurs and start yet more businesses. This will ultimately lead to positive payoffs such as job creation and improved well-being for all, thus also contributing to fulfilling the SDG goals. Today, there is little doubt that women entrepreneurs are and will increasingly be an intrinsic part of the backbone of economic growth and stability for nations worldwide as they recover from the impacts of the global pandemic. We would like to congratulate all involved for an excellent multi-stakeholder consultation process and sharing of multidisciplinary expertise leading to this report, especially when facing pandemic challenges themselves. We sincerely hope that our findings, and the resulting messages that policymakers and other decision makers can take from them, will help our sponsors and important organizations across the globe to achieve the ambitious objective of “leaving no one behind” in the important area of entrepreneurship.

abstract = Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) is a consortium of national country teams, primarily associated with top academic institutions, that carries out survey-based research on entrepreneurship around the world. GEM is the only global research source that collects data on entrepreneurship directly from individual entrepreneurs. GEM’s Adult Population Survey (APS) provides analysis on the characteristics, motivations, and ambitions of individuals starting businesses, as well as social attitudes towards entrepreneurship. The National Expert Survey (NES) looks at the national context in which individuals start businesses. The unique GEM tools and data benefit numerous stakeholder groups: • Academics are able to apply unique approaches to studying entrepreneurship at the national level. • Policymakers are able to make better-informed decisions to help their entrepreneurial ecosystems thrive. • Entrepreneurs have better knowledge on where to invest and influence. • Sponsors collaborate with GEM to advance their organizational interests. • International organizations leverage the entrepreneurial insights from GEM through reports and events. In numbers, GEM is: • 22 years of data • 200,000+ interviews a year • 110+ economies • 500+ specialists in entrepreneurship research • 300+ academic and research institutions • 200+ funding institutions GEM began in 1999 as a joint project between Babson College (USA) and London Business School (UK). The consortium has become the richest resource of information on entrepreneurship, publishing a range of global, national, and “special topic” reports on an annual basis.

volume = {11},
journal = {Journal of Entrepreneurship and Public Policy},
doi = {10.1108/JEPP-07-2022-0074}
abstract = Purpose There is a large literature about crisis entrepreneurship, spanning from necessity, natural disaster and long-term conflict entrepreneurship. This paper situates pandemic entrepreneurship as a unique form of crisis entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach The authors utilize the Kirznerian and Schumpeterian theories of entrepreneurship to understand pandemic entrepreneurship. Using evidence from the US COVID-19 pandemic, the authors argue that pandemics impact both the “identification” and “action” moments of entrepreneurship. Findings The Kirznerian identification moment becomes much more uncertain for entrepreneurs because of fluctuating conditions, such as public health conditions, new potential variants of the virus causing the pandemic, shifting government mandates and rules and so forth. The Schumpeterian action moment becomes more challenging because of the necessity of physical distancing and because, generally, all crises raise the cost of entrepreneurial action. That said, the authors still document considerable entrepreneurship during pandemics as entrepreneurs adapt to the increased uncertainty and costs by rely upon local and customary knowledge. Research limitations/implications This research finds that entrepreneurs, depending upon the crisis, face differing constraints. Specifically in times of pandemic, entrepreneurs face difficulty recognizing opportunities because of shifting conditions and acting upon opportunities because of financial and political constraints. This research thus implies that there are large opportunities for alleviation of such constraints if there were to be future variants or pandemics. Practical implications Practically speaking, this research affects how people study entrepreneurship. By recognizing the differing constraints that pandemic entrepreneurs face, the authors can better understand the last several years, and can also prepare better policy wise for future pandemics or further variants of COVID-19. Social implications Socially, entrepreneurship can be a large factor in recovery from disasters and crises. By recognizing and perhaps alleviating constraints that pandemic entrepreneurs face, future crises could have better responses and recoveries. Originality/value Although several studies have examined entrepreneurship during the COVID-19 pandemic, the extant literature on pandemic entrepreneurship remains relatively underdeveloped and has not yet focused on what distinguishes pandemic entrepreneurship from other forms of crisis entrepreneurship. The authors highlight what pandemic entrepreneurship has in common with other forms of crisis entrepreneurship and pinpoint the various ways that is distinct.

doi = {10.1007/978-3-031-24884-9_1}
abstract = Cleaner entrepreneurship is an outgrowth of social entrepreneurship, which is manifested by the social consciousness, persistence, and values associated with stakeholders and social development. Broadly, cleaner entrepreneurship is supported by transformational leadership, public policies, and affordable technology to benefit social development and stakeholder values. The business model for cleaner entrepreneurship is thus based on the triple bottom line comprising people (stakeholders), planet (sustainability), and profit (profit-with-purpose). The cleaner entrepreneurship embeds the global sustainability development goals focusing on community commons. This chapter addresses, the role of public policies, society, and industries to support cleaner entrepreneurship at the bottom of the pyramid by integrating stakeholders and community. The entrepreneurial mindset to bridge the global–local entrepreneurship is also critically examined in this chapter.

abstract = The study aims to identify the trends in entrepreneurship education in prominent journals. A total of 2185 indexed research publications made up the studied data. The R bibliometric tool is then used to analyze the data to determine the bibliometric map of the evolution of entrepreneurship education. According to the findings, there have been a substantial number of publications on the growth of entrepreneurial education research. Wibowo A, Huang-Saad A, and Narmaditya BS are the authors who frequently do study on this topic during the research time. The co-occurrence network was also developed and was divided into three clusters. The major themes developed out of the co-occurrence network are determinants of entrepreneurship education for building an entrepreneurial intention among students in higher education, entrepreneurship in the classroom, and innovation and entrepreneurship education. This study has also brought in future research topics based on prominence percentile using SciVal. This study’s originality is from presenting a structured and in-depth literature review that describes the current state of the art for entrepreneurship education. A complete analysis of the knowledge acquired about its entrepreneurship education is offered to enhance the further research.

doi = {10.1007/978-981-19-5747-5_1}
abstract = Through the passage of time, mankind has witnessed evolution of business structures. Right from sharp edged stones to forged metal swords and today laser sharpened sophisticated blades used for grooming purposes. All this transformation has not only been experienced through the products that we use and the businesses that we see today but also the concepts and methodology that gave rise to such transformations. One of this is entrepreneurship, a term that embraces everything that is new, everything that is useful and everything that has the potential to change the future course of action and the way we look at the world. Entrepreneurship can be considered as a natural phenomenon of every business. It is the integral nature that provides the element of an enterprise to a business moving beyond production, distribution, and exchange. The chapter aims at providing in-depth insights about various concepts pertaining to entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship through extensive review of literature covering broad dimensions of entrepreneurship. The chapter incorporates highlights from different pertinent theories related to entrepreneurship and tries to present an elaborated description of the concept and critical aspects associated with the same. As entrepreneurship is defined, understood, and percolated variously in different parts of the world, a model for entrepreneurship is also established using insights from various literatures. The last section of the chapter discusses the recent scenario of entrepreneurship in India and its accomplishments in recent times.

abstract = COVID19 brought challenges and threats to entrepreneurs and their organizations. At the end of December 2019, the coronavirus (COVID19) started spreading from Wuhan, China to other countries so widely and quickly, that on 11th March 2020, World Health Organization – WHO (2020) declared COVID19 pandemic. As a response to mitigate coronavirus spread and save lives, governments in affected countries imposed desperate measures of social distancing, widespread lockdown, restrictions on travelling, movement, and people gatherings. COVID19 has significantly influenced the entrepreneurial activities. COVID19 influenced traditional entrepreneurial decision-making processes. Some entrepreneurs had to close their businesses temporarily as a result of governmental restrictions and others had to impose precautions and to run their activities in reduced extent.

title = {GEM 2021/22 Women’s Entrepreneurship Report: From Crisis to Opportunity}
abstract = This year’s report highlights several compelling findings from GEM 2021/22 data, from gender composition of high-potential startups to pandemic impacts and national expert ratings of the enabling environment for women entrepreneurs. Women tend to be somewhat less active globally than men when it comes to startup activity (on average, 10.4% of women surveyed versus 13.6% of men). In other words, women represent two out of every five early-stage entrepreneurs that are active globally. Also noteworthy are some other sometimes counter-intuitive findings: • Globally, women represent about one in three high-growth entrepreneurs and one in three innovation entrepreneurs that are focused on national and international markets. • Women entrepreneurs in upper–middle-income countries represent some of the most innovative, high-growth entrepreneurs globally, and are at parity with men with regard to international market focus. • As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, women experienced similar declines to men in entrepreneurial intentions (to start a business) but sharper declines in startup rates in 2020. However, this was not the case in upper–middle-income countries, where both startup intentions and rates for women actually rose, by 4% and 11%, respectively, from 2019 to 2021. • Overall, business exit rates for women rose from 2.9% to 3.6% over the two-year pandemic period, in contrast to the higher rates for men (3.5% to 4.4%). Women in upper–middle-income countries showed the largest pandemic impact on business exit with a 74% increase from 2019 to 2021, compared to only 34% for men. • National experts generally rate the enabling environment for women entrepreneurs very low in most countries. This may explain the persistence of lower entrepreneurial perceptions for women compared to men in these countries. Countries with the highest expert ratings also experienced the highest levels of entrepreneurial intentions. This report offers a trend analysis of women’s entrepreneurship in 50 countries, five global regions and three national income levels. We focus on four key themes in the first half of the report, followed by a closer analysis of region- and country-specific patterns in the second half. The four themes are (1) gender differences in rates at various points in the entrepreneurial lifecycle, from intentions through to startup activity, new business, established business and business exit; (2) gender differences

Social enterprise in Kazakhstan, although a new phenomenon that has not been fully reflected in theoretical societies, empirical research, and public policy, is widely used in foreign practice as a tool for the development of the social sphere. And in the future, it is proved that this type of entrepreneurship allows solving many social problems, providing employment and removing the dependence of many target groups on state aid.

The crisis in several sectors caused by the pandemic of the new coronavirus, raised other research possibilities. With a qualitative approach and through the case study method, using a structured questionnaire, it sought to investigate a group of companies/projects incubated in a technology-based business incubator, in the municipality of Mossoró in the state of Rio Grande do Norte. With the results, it was possible to verify that incubated have a positive perception about the importance of entrepreneurship in facing the crisis, thus pointing out that it is an alternative for the post-pandemic crisis period.

journal = {Asian Journal of Economics, Business and Accounting},
doi = {10.9734/ajeba/2021/v21i2330529}
abstract = The disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis has triggered worldwide multiple environmental, social, political, and economic consequences. In the entrepreneurship domain, now it is the time for reimagining the relationship between people (employees, customers) and technology. This is very important in the Australasian area (Oceania countries, OC), which aspire to digital transformation and scalable green entrepreneurship (enjoying a broad range of social, cultural, and corporate programs and initiatives) whilst facing serious environmental, social, political, economic and governance problems. The disruptions brought by the COVID-19 pandemic crisis have made OC countries and a number of international and domestic companies think about increasing the resilience of their production through sustainable, green, and scalable investments and management (e.g. supply diversification, geographically closer to customers activities and delivery centers, shorter supply chains, smarter solutions, thoughtful initiatives, increased home production, smart scalable inventories, open governance, new technology transformation, adaptable management, trusted relations, etc.). In this article, we examine several green entrepreneurship perceptions and green investment initiatives should formed in the Australasian area just after the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, the factors that influenced these perceptions/initiatives, and the consequences should they had on the political, social, and economic dynamics in OC. This article is an empirical one as the data collection process was performed by specific designed questionaries and several person reviews to CEOs of about twenty (20) enterprises operating at the wider Oceanian area (greater Oceania). The main article’s objectives are the following: (i) to analyze how the OC economies could benefit from these initiatives after the COVID-19 pandemic crisis; and (ii) to form the suitable environmental, social, economic, and governance commitments. Findings and proposed entrepreneurship analysis is complemented, in Section 4, by a review of the environmental, social, and governance commitments (operating as nine “financing constraints” with great corporate finance functionalities), which should operate (in the post COVID-19 era) as economic reform by national authorities in Oceania countries, through specific financial support programmes/initiatives and various policy measures, mostly for small and medium-sized enterprises. For instance, four key findings were recorded in the commitment “Environmental issues”. The results of the presented research, as recommendations, were referred to the adoption of good and innovative practices for sustainable green entrepreneurship in OC. In particular, the relationship between people (employees, customers) and the new technology was discussed and documented, as well as the issue of “digital transformation in the OC entrepreneurship” by identified nine (9) commitments that fully or partially support green entrepreneurship; the concept of “team-work collaboration” (collaborative entrepreneurship and solutions); and the “geospatial optimization” initiative (e.g. geospatial optimization for delivery centers) were introduced, analyzed and documented. The major findings of the presented applied research are these nine (9) perceptions/commitments as they presented and documented in this article. Also, the impact and significant influence of these findings to international and local (Oceanian) companies is obvious -because of the scalable nature of these nine (9) restrictions- particularly in the green entrepreneurship domain and for those companies involved in a digital transformation process. Also, in order to support a scalable green entrepreneurship, in the post COVID-19 times, we propose new financial initiatives like the Australasia External Investment Plan (A-EIP) with its three pillars: The Australasia Fund for Sustainable Development (A-EFSD); The Australasia Fund for Sustainable Development Plus (EFSD+); and The Australasia Multiannual Financial Framework (A-MFF). Finally, the concept “team-work” and the terms “team Australasia” and “working better together” as they are related to a scalable green entrepreneurship in the post COVID-19 era are introduced and documented.

Purpose The Covid-19 pandemic has affected the world in an unprecedented manner. The economic recession in 2020 is expected to be the most serious since the Second World War. This study aims to analyse the likely consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic crisis on entrepreneurship and new venture activity. Design/methodology/approach The paper focuses first on the major shocks caused by the pandemic that may affect entrepreneurial activity. To do so, the authors briefly review the literature about the previous financial crisis and its effects on entrepreneurship. Then, the manuscript means to disentangle how these shocks will impinge on the different stages and motives within the entrepreneurial process. Findings This analysis reveals that the consequences of the pandemic for entrepreneurship will be generally damaging, but they may not be so tremendously negative as originally thought. We could initially expect a broad downturn in entrepreneurial activity. Soon after that, however, necessity entrepreneurship is likely to boom. At the same time, but to a lesser extent, high-potential entrepreneurial activity could also be fostered, provided the recovery is quick and there is sufficient support from the environment and institutions. Originality/value This is probably one of the first academic reflections on the likely effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on entrepreneurship. It specifically addresses the role of institutions and how they may differently affect necessity and opportunity entrepreneurship. It also suggests interesting related research areas and some basic recommendations on how to help entrepreneurs overcome it.

abstract = This study aims to explain the strengthening of entrepreneurship based on sharia empowerment for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in dealing with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. This research focuses on three things: 1) Indonesian MSMEs, 2) Moslem entrepreneurship, and 3) Sharia empowerment. Using qualitative approaches, descriptive methods, and exploratory analysis, this research tries to provide the rationale for strengthening MSMEs using the spectacle of sharia empowerment amidst the pandemic. Despite the halt of business operations in this pandemic, we found that many MSMEs, which are home-based businesses, have sprung up but need an empowerment process to survive and thrive. This condition is seen as a major challenge for sharia empowerment programs. This paper provides a conceptual framework to understand how sharia empowerment can strengthen the MSMEs. However, this research has some limitations, one of which is the inability to validate the findings directly; therefore, we encourage further research to cover these matters.

abstract = This chapter relies on a related logic when imagining the concept and role of social entrepreneurship in community recovery and development in the post-COVID-19 pandemic period. The first confirmed case in Nigeria, the country of the authors’ analysis, was announced on February 27, 2020. Since then, the number of identified cases has risen rapidly to 52,000. This has affected the economic activities of the country that recently came out of recession. The challenges Nigeria faces are to revive the economy and to reduce persistent unemployment and poverty levels, which impact the country’s micro-economic and macro-economic activities negatively. Overcoming these challenges requires a refocus on the role of social entrepreneurship in job creation, the improvement of the standard of living, a reduction in the poverty level as well as an increase in social growth and development, as entrepreneurship has been recognized as a key ingredient for economic growth and development. This refocusing was demonstrated by discussing how social entrepreneurship and humanism can make a positive contribution to the micro and macro growth of the community and of the nation at large. Reviews of recent and relevant literatures on the predictor and criterion variables revealed that social entrepreneurship leads to improved welfare of the society. The improved welfare of society adjusts to the pressing needs of the people by providing various packages of solutions for the problems that the people experience, as the provision of solutions is an important aid to improved economic standardization. Moreover, it is obvious that the solution to this global challenge lies in human support and human actions in this global trying time.

title = {The state of "Innovation" and "Entrepreneurship" in India -A Post Pandemic Bibliometric Analysis}
abstract = Indeed, "Innovation" has become the most sought-after term in the decade. "Entrepreneurship" is the second one to follow. Despite this, many organisations still struggle to define both of these phrases. Many authors have emphasised that innovation is a process and a mindset, not merely a concept [1]. The term "Entrepreneurship" was also misinterpreted at first. The researchers concentrated their efforts on finding persons in society who run successful businesses. However, scholars gradually shifted their emphasis to the intersection between innovative individuals and the possibilities they possessed, focusing on successful businessmen [2]. In the classical work of entrepreneurship, J. Cunningham mentioned that despite being the most interesting word, we still do not understand entrepreneurs [3]. During and after the covid-19 epidemic, the entire globe witnessed a total change in organizational procedures and operations. The necessity of the hour was to investigate how researchers and academics saw the covid-19 epidemic in terms of innovation and entrepreneurship. In the post-pandemic era, it was widely acknowledged and known that these disruptions would produce breakthroughs and lead to inventive enterprises. This paper is an attempt to bibliometrically analyze the state of entrepreneurship and innovation in the post-pandemic research artefacts. 78 research papers published in the year 2020 & 21 selected exclusively from Scopus Indexed Journals were considered in this study. The paper will analyze the co-authorship, co-occurrence, citation, bibliographic coupling and co-citation analysis of all these papers.

abstract = This paper examines the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (measured by total cases and deaths per 100K people) on the early-stage entrepreneurship activity (measured by the Kauffman Early-Stage Entrepreneurship indicators) in the United States. The empirical analyses are based on the panel dataset of 51 States between 2020 and 2021. The findings show that the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affects early-stage entrepreneurship activity. Further analyses indicate the positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the startup's early survival rate. However, new entrepreneurs' rate and opportunity share are negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Implications for the post-COVID-19 era are also discussed.
